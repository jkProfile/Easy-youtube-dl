# Easy-youtube-dl
This is an extension of the youtube-dl project to make it a bit easier to use.



What does it do?:
This is a simple script that asks you if you want to download audio or video, where you want to save the files, and then uses youtube-dl.exe with those parameters to complete the task.

There are two configuration files in this project. Please refer to the youtube-dl documentation if you want to add or remove functionality:
